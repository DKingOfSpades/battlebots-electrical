Safety LED Controller
=====================

Combat robotics competitions require power indication LEDs for heavy weight class robots. This repo has the electrical designs and firmware for controllers based on the ATtiny85 microcontroller and Adafruit Neopixel strips. `cassowari-original.sch` is a reverse-engineered schematic from the perfboard power LED controller from the original [Cassowari](https://wiki.robojackets.org/Cassowari) robot. The `cassowarii-controller` files are for the new Cassowarii robot's controller.
