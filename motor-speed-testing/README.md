Motor Speed Testing
===================

Using an Arduino and [this sensor](https://www.horizonhobby.com/aircraft-telemetry-brushless-rpm-sensor-spma9558), graph the speed of a brushless motor versus time on a computer for later analysis. The sensor receives 5V from the Arduino and is connected to two phases of the brushless motor under test. It outputs the current time and speed to the serial port.
